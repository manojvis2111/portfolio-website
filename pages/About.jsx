            <p>
                My name is Vishnu Manoj, and I'm a third year computer science and math student at the
                University of Toronto. Computer Science is such a vast field with several interesting areas such as Software Engineering,
                Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision. I am still in the learning stage of my life 
                and I look forward to  mess around with all the intriguing fields of Computer Science until I 
                find the one thing that I will get obsessed with for the rest of my life.  

            <br />

                I have also been math teaching assistant here at my university. I have also had
                the privilage to be a part of a virtual exchange program that was jointly promoted by AIESEC in
                Salvador and AIESEC in Edmonton for which I had developed English language classes for Brazilian 
                students (ages 12- 42). And now, I am one of the Technology Leads for the upcoming Niagara Summer Games 2022.

                During my free time I like to watch anime, play badminton,learn guitar tutorials of some of my favorite songs
                , cook delicious food, and play video games. So if you ever want to have a cooking showdown or 
                debate about which is the best video game of all time, hit me up!
